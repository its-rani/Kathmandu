  <h2> <center> TEMPLES AND STUPA </center></h2>
<p align="justify">The Kathmandu Valley in Nepal is renowned for its rich cultural heritage, highlighted by its stunning temples and stupas. These religious structures reflect the valley's profound Hindu and Buddhist traditions.

Temples in the Kathmandu Valley are typically dedicated to Hindu deities. The most famous is the Pashupatinath Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, revered as one of the holiest shrines for Shiva devotees. Another significant temple is the Taleju Temple, known for its exquisite architecture and historical importance.

Stupas, on the other hand, are primarily Buddhist monuments. The Swayambhunath Stupa, also known as the Monkey Temple, stands atop a hill, offering panoramic views of the city. It is one of the oldest and most revered stupas in Nepal. Another iconic stupa is the Boudhanath Stupa, one of the largest in the world. Its massive mandala makes it a focal point of Tibetan Buddhism in Nepal.

These structures are not merely architectural marvels but also vibrant centers of worship and cultural activities. They exemplify the syncretism of Hinduism and Buddhism in the Kathmandu Valley, showcasing centuries-old traditions and the enduring spiritual legacy of Nepal. </p>
